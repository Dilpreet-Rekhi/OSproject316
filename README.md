# Automated Deadlock Detection Tool

## Overview
The Automated Deadlock Detection Tool is a web-based application that identifies and resolves deadlocks in operating systems by analyzing process-resource dependencies. Built using Python, Flask, and NetworkX, the tool visualizes resource allocation graphs and detects circular wait conditions in real-time.

## Features
- **Deadlock Detection**: Implements Banker's Algorithm and cycle detection to identify deadlocks
- **Visualization**: Displays resource allocation graphs using NetworkX/D3.js
- **Resolution Suggestions**: Provides actionable solutions like process termination or resource preemption
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks process-resource allocations
- **Interactive UI**: Web-based dashboard for configuration and visualization

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), NetworkX (graph analysis)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js (visualization)
- **Algorithms**: Banker's Algorithm, Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) analysis

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Flask
- NetworkX
- psutil (for system monitoring integration)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deadlock-detector.git
   cd deadlock-detector
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the tool in your browser:  
   ```

   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Predictive deadlock avoidance using machine learning
- Support for distributed systems
- User-defined deadlock resolution policies
- Historical data logging and analysis
- Integration with system monitoring tools (Prometheus/Nagios)
